# Warp puzzle

## What is it
1. decode a shift cipher
2. RE a .class
3. adjust your sys clock or just copy the answer from the class

## Hash mapping
it'd be real nice to have hash(username) -> date directly just as everything has before
hack\_hash has a savage # of dates tho
we'll use the first 8 bits (2^8 = 256 possible days)
to gen a date hash in the same fashion as hack-hash
